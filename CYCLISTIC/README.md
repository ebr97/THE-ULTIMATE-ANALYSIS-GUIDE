# Cyclistic Case Study

## About the company

A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself
apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with
disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about
8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to
commute to work each day.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments.
One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes,
and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers
who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

### The business task

Converting more casual riders to annual members by indentify how the two types of riders use Cyclistic bike differently by analysing the data from the previous year (2021).

## Tehnical Stuff
This project is second one of two capstone projects from Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. For this capstone I choose to do my analysis in Jupyter Notebook, because I wanted to have all the steps from raw data to insights and visualisations in one place.

## Important
You can see the capstone on Kaggle too: https://www.kaggle.com/code/bucuremil/cyclistic-analysis-with-python
