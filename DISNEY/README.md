# Let's see into the future of the Disney Movies

This is a analysis of the success of the Disney Movies with the main goal of providing recommandations for increasing earnings of the future videos

I will run my analysis entirely on SQL Server and I will use Power BI to the the visuals
As you'll see the analysis will concentrate on the table disney_movies_total_gross
I think you'll find the insights quite interesting

## About the dataset

The dataset explores the box office data of Walt Disney Studios from beginning to 2016. It includes information on the movie title, release date, main character, villain, and songs associated with each film. This dataset provides insights into how different elements contribute to a movie's success or failure
